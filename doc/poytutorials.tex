These tutorials are intended to provide guidance for more sophisticated applications of \poy that involve multiple steps and a combination of different commands. Each tutorial contains a \poy script that is followed by detailed commentaries explaining the rationale behind each step of the analysis. Although these analyses can be conducted interactively using the \emph{Interactive Console} or running separate sequential analyses using the \emph{Graphical User Interphace}, the most practical way to do this is to use \poy scripts (see \emph{ POY4 Quick Start} for more information on \poy scripts).

It is important to remember that the numerical values for most command arguments will differ substantially depending on type, complexity, and size of the data. Therefore, the values used here should not be taken as optimal parameters.

The tutorials use sample datasets that are provided with \poy installation but can also be downloaded from the \poy site at
\begin{center}
\texttt{http://research.amnh.org/scicomp/projects/poy.php}
\end{center}
The minimal required items to run the tutorial analyses are the \poy application and the sample datafiles. Running these analyses requires some familiarity with \poy interface and command structure that can be found in the preceding chapters.

\section{Combining  search strategies}{\label{tutorial1}}
The following script implements a strategy for a thorough search. This is accomplished by generating a large number of independent initial trees by random addition sequence and combining combining different search strategies that aim at thoroughly exploring local tree space and escape the effect of composite optima by effectively traversing the tree space. In addition, this script shows how to output the status of the search to a log file and calculate the duration of the search. 

\begin{verbatim}
(* search using all data *)
read("*.seq", "morph.ss", aminoacids:("myosin.aa"))
set(seed:1, log:"all_data_search.log", root:"taxon1")
report(timer:"search start")
transform (tcm:(1,2), gap_opening:1)
build(250)
swap(threshold:5.0)
select()
perturb(transform(static_approx), iterations:15,ratchet:(0.2,3))
select()
fuse(iterations:200, swap())
select()
report("all_trees", trees:(total) ,"constree", graphconsensus,
"diagnosis", diagnosis)
report(timer:"search end")
set(nolog)
exit()
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{(* search using all data *)} This first line of the script is a comment. While comments are optional and do not affect the analyses, they provide are useful for housekeeping purposes.
\item \texttt{read("*.seq", "morph.ss", aminoacids:("myosin.aa"))}
This command imports all the nucleotide sequence datafiles (all files with the extension \texttt{.seq}), a morphological datafile \texttt{morph.ss} in Hennig86 format, and an aminoacid datafile \texttt{myosin.aa}.
\item \texttt{set(seed:1, log:"all\_data\_search.log", root:"taxon")} The \poycommand{set} command specifies conditions prior to tree searching. The \poyargument{seed} is used to ensure that the subsequent randomization procedures (such as tree building and selecting) are reproducible. Specifying the log produces a file, \texttt{all\_data\_search.log} that provides an additional means to monitor the process of the search. The outgroup (\texttt{taxon1}) is designated by the \poyargument{root}, so that all the reported trees have the desired polarity. By default, the analysis is performed using direct optimization.
\item \texttt{report(timer:"search start")} In combination with \texttt{report(timer:"search end")}, this commands reports the amount of time that the execution of commands enclosed by \poyargument{timer} takes. In this case, it reports how long it takes for the entire search to finish. Using timer is useful for planning a complex search strategy for large datasets that can take a long time to complete: it is instructive, for example, to know how long a search would last with a single replicate (one starting tree) before starting a search with multiple replicates.
\item \texttt{transform (tcm:(1,2), gap\_opening:1)} This command sets the transformation cost matrix for molecular data to be used in calculating the cost of the tree. Note, that in addition to the substitution and indel costs, the \poycommand{transform} specifies the cost for gap opening.
\item \texttt{build(250)} This commands begins tree-building step of the search that generates 250 random-addition trees. A large number of independent starting point insures that thee large portion of tree space have been examined.
\item \texttt{swap(threshold:5.0)} \poycommand{swap} specifies that each of the 250 trees is subjected to alternating SPR and TBR branch swapping routine (the default of \poy). In addition to the most optimal trees, all the suboptimal trees found within 5\% of the best cost are thoroughly evaluated. This step ensures that the local searches settled on the local optima.
\item \texttt{select()} Upon completion of branch swapping, this command retains only optimal and topologically unique trees; all other trees are discarded from memory. 
\item \texttt{perturb(transform(static\_approx), iterations:15,ratchet:(0.2,3))} This command subjects the resulting trees to 15 rounds of ratchet, re-weighting 20\% of characters by a factor of 2. During ratcheting, the dynamic homology characters are transformed into static homology characters, so that the re-weigted characters nucleotides. This step, that begins at multiple local maxima, is intended to further traverse the tree space in search of a global optimum.
\item \texttt{fuse(iterations:200, swap())} In this step, up to 200 swappings of branches identical in terminal composition but different in topology, are performed between pairs of best trees recovered in the previous step. This is another strategy for further exploration of tree space. Each resulting tree is further refined by local branch swapping under the default parameters of \poycommand{swap}.
\item \texttt{select()} Upon completion of branch swapping, this command retains only optimal and topologically unique trees; all other trees are discarded from memory.
\item \texttt{report("all\_trees", trees:(total) ,"constree", graphconsensus, "diagnosis", diagnosis)} This command produces a series of outputs of the results of the search. It includes a file containing best trees in parenthetical notation and their costs (\texttt{all\_trees}), a graphical representation (in PostScript format) of the strict consensus (\texttt{constree}), and the diagnoses for all best trees (\texttt{diagnosis}).
\item \texttt{report(timer:"search end")} This command stops timing the duration of search, initiated by the command \texttt{report(timer:"search start")}.
\item \texttt{set(nolog)} This command stops reporting any output to the log file, \texttt{all\_data\_search.log}.
\item \texttt{exit()} This commands ends the \poy session.
\end{itemize}

\section{Searching under iterative pass}{\label{tutorial2}}
The following script implements a strategy for a thorough search under iterative pass optimization. The iterative pass optimization is a very time consuming procedure that makes it impractical to conduct under this kind of optimization (save for very small datasets that can be analyzed within reasonable time). The iterative pass, however, can be used for the most advanced stages of the analysis for the final refinement, when a potential global optimum has been reached through searches under other kinds of optimization (such as direct optimization). Therefore, this tutorial begins with importing an existing tree (rather than performing tree building from scratch) and subjecting it to local branch swapping under iterative pass.

\begin{verbatim}
(* search using all data under ip *)
read("*.seq", "morph.ss", aminoacids:("myosin.aa"))
read("inter_tree.tre")
transform (tcm:(1,2), gap_opening:1)
set(iterative)
swap()
select()
report("all_trees", trees:(total) ,"constree", graphconsensus,
"diagnosis", diagnosis)
exit()
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{(* search using all data under ip *)} This first line of the script is a comment. While comments are optional and do not affect the analyses, they provide are useful for housekeeping purposes.
\item \texttt{read("*.seq", "morph.ss", aminoacids:("myosin.aa"))} This command imports all the nucleotide sequence datafiles (all files with the extension \texttt{.seq}), a morphological datafile \texttt{morph.ss} in Hennig86 format, and an aminoacid datafile \texttt{myosin.aa}.
\item \texttt{read("inter\_tree.tre")} This command imports a tree file, \texttt{inter\_tree.tre}, that contains the most optimal tree from prior analyses. 
\item \texttt{transform (tcm:(1,2), gap\_opening:1)} This command sets the transformation cost matrix for molecular data to be used in calculating the cost of the tree. Note, that in addition to the substitution and indel costs, the \poycommand{transform} specifies the cost for gap opening.
\item \texttt{set(iterative)} This command sets the optimization procedure to iterative pass.
\item \texttt{swap(around)} This commands specifies that the the imported tree is subjected to alternating SPR and TBR branch swapping routine (the default of \poy) following the trajectory of search that completely evaluates the neighborhood of the tree (by using \poyargument{around}).
\item \texttt{select()} Upon completion of branch swapping, this command retains only optimal and topologically unique trees; all other trees are discarded from memory.
\item \texttt{report("all\_trees", trees:(total) ,"constree", graphconsensus, "diagnosis", diagnosis)} This command produces a series of outputs of the results of the search. It includes a file containing best trees in parenthetical notation and their costs (\texttt{all\_trees}), a graphical representation (in PostScript format) of the strict consensus (\texttt{constree}), and the diagnoses for all best trees (\texttt{diagnosis}).
\item \texttt{exit()} This commands ends the \poy session.
\end{itemize}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Generate 100 random addition sequence Wagner trees.
%\item Discard duplicate trees.
%\item Perform cladogram searching by fusing one pair of trees in memory. Note: Tree

%Matrices}{\label{tutorial4}}

%This tutorial builds on Tutorials~\ref{tutorial2} and~\ref{tutorial3}, and introduces the use of input trees 
%and complex differential cost step matrices.

%characters (i.e., unaligned DNA sequences) to assign indel events a cost 
%of 4, transitions 1, and transversions 2. All static homology characters 
%(i.e., the phenotypic characters in the file morph.txt) are upweighted by

%sequences, not individual nucleotide characters. Tutorial 7 shows how to 
%estimate bootstrap frequencies using static homology, which allows nucleotide-
%level characters to be sampled.

%\poy output window.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{enumerate}

%\section[Bootstrap Support with Static Homologies]{Support III: Bootstrap Support Using Static Homology}

%This tutorial builds on the previous tutorials to illustrate the calculation of 
%bootstrap frequencies. Here, bootstrap frequencies are obtained from analysis of

%level characters to be sampled instead of whole fragments, as is done using 
%dynamic homology. 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Type:

%    swap ()[enter]
%    select ()[enter]
%    report (asciitrees, diagnosis) [enter]
%    \end{verbatim}

%The above commands will perform the following tasks using default parameters:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Clear all data and trees from memory.
%    \item Import datafile mit5.txt.
%    \item Treat all data as pertaining to unannotated chromosome data, setting the 
%        following parameters: inversion distance and cost 15, locus indel 10 + 1.5 
%        times the length (number of nucleotides) of the locus, keep three 
%        candidate medians, swap on medians for 5 rounds, treat as circular

%        file (non-ncurses version), reporting the cost of each tree.
%    \item Output the optimal median states and edge costs.
%    \item Treat all data as pertaining to unannotated chromosome data with 
%        parameters as above but using optimization alignment (not fixed-states) to 
%        approximate chromosome medians.   
%    \item Alternate SPR and TBR branch swapping of each tree in memory.
%    \item Draw optimal trees in \poy Output window (ncurses version only) or output 
%        file (non-ncurses version), reporting the cost of each tree.
